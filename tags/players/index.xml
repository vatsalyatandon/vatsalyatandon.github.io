      <description>In this blog post, we are going to analyse the complete dataset from the FIFA 19 videogame, containing all the players currently playing professional football at all levels, including some fake players created by EA for future simulations. The dataset was made available by Sofifa.
We can divide the whole post into 2 segments, namely:
 Feature Engineering and Analysis
 Clustering
  Link for part 1.
2) Clustering Now that we have feature engineered our dataset, we can look forward to the task of finding value for money players.</description>
