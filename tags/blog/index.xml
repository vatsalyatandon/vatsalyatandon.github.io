      <description>In this blog post, we are going to analyse the complete dataset from the FIFA 19 videogame, containing all the players currently playing professional football at all levels, including some fake players created by EA for future simulations. The dataset was made available by Sofifa.
We can divide the whole post into 2 segments, namely:
 Feature Engineering and Analysis
 Clustering
  Link for part 1.
2) Clustering Now that we have feature engineered our dataset, we can look forward for the task of finding value for money players.</description>

  1) Feature Engineering and Analysis First of all let&amp;rsquo;s load the dataset into a Python notebook and see what&amp;rsquo;s inside.</description>

      <description>In this blog we are going to develop a live image classifier through webcam feed right in our browser using the model - YOLO
This whole task requires the following two libraries :
 ml5.js, an easy-to-use ML framework built on top of Tensorflow.js
 p5.js, a JS library to facilitate easy design and drawing functionality
  1) Create directory and files First of all create a directory of the name of your project (say &amp;ldquo;YOLO-ML5&amp;rdquo;).</description>
