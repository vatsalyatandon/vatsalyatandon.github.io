---------------------------

I am a third year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur, with my major being Chemical Engineering. My primary interests lie in the field of application of Data Science for Social Good. This is the reason I co-founded the [IIT Consulting Group](https://http://iitkconsult.surge.sh/). Apart from that I have a profound interest in Machine Learning, particularly in the domain of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I happen to be one of the Senator at the Students' Gymkhana, IITK for the term 2019-20. I also like quizzing and am the Co-Ordinator of the [Quiz Club, IITK](https://www.facebook.com/qciitk/) and in my free time, I watch documentaries and solve puzzles :)
